This code demonstrates my ability to work with lists, loops, and conditional statements in Python, which are essential skills in data analysis and programming.

Carly-s-Clippers is a Python code that performs various calculations and operations on three lists of data. The first list, "hairstyles," is a list of strings that contains different types of hairstyles. The second list, "prices," contains the prices for each corresponding hairstyle. The third list, "last_week," contains the number of haircuts of each hairstyle that were performed in the last week.

The code starts by calculating the total price of all haircuts by adding up the prices in the "prices" list. Then it calculates the average price by dividing the total price by the number of prices in the list. It then creates a new list of prices by subtracting 5 from each price in the "prices" list.

Next, the code calculates the total revenue by multiplying the price of each haircut in the "prices" list by the number of haircuts performed in the last week in the "last_week" list and adding the results. Then it calculates the average daily revenue by dividing the total revenue by 7.

Finally, the code creates a new list called "cuts_under_30" that contains the names of all hairstyles whose new price (calculated earlier) is less than 30.

To explain this code to an employer, you can mention that it is a program that performs data analysis and calculations on haircuts' prices and popularity based on the number of haircuts performed and their prices. This code can be used to extract valuable insights into the most popular haircuts, the average price of haircuts, the total revenue generated, and the most affordable haircuts.
